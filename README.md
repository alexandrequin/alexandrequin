## Hi there üëã

I‚Äôm **Alexandre Quin**, a Full Stack JavaScript developer specializing in **Node.js**.

I started my career with 2 years of experience as a Full Stack WordPress Developer. After that, I completed a Web Developer & Designer training program, where I strengthened my skills in **front-end and back-end development, software architecture, and database management**. This training helped me refine my expertise in modern web technologies and adopt best development practices.  
Today, I focus mainly on **back-end development with Node.js**.

üíª I love designing **APIs and microservices** with Node.js, constantly exploring best practices in back-end development. I‚Äôm also passionate about **open-source projects** and enjoy tinkering with Linux servers to optimize my work environment.

‚öôÔ∏è With a strong interest in **DevOps**, I like automating tasks to improve productivity and reliability. Whether through scripts, CI/CD pipelines, or orchestration tools, I‚Äôm always looking for ways to optimize development and deployment workflows.

ü§ñ Fascinated by **artificial intelligence**, I enjoy experimenting with the latest advancements in AI.

üéÆ Outside of coding, I‚Äôm a big fan of **manga and video games**.

üöÄ Always eager to learn and grow, I‚Äôm open to discussions and collaborations!
